### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Bakhtiyar Aigozhiyev*, and I'm a **Data Scientist** with a passion for math and complex problems.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

## Work Experience

- **Data Scientist, Magnum Cash and Carry** (November, 2022 - Present)
As a Data Scientist at Magnum Cash and Carry, I work on various projects that involve data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop data-driven solutions that optimize business processes and enhance decision-making. For example *LightGBM* model for predicting new potential market' income and forecasting sales of existing markets.

 - **Co-Founder, SparkRead** (December, 2020 - July, 2021)
I was one of the co-founders of SparkRead, a startup that aimed to aggregate book clubs and promote reading. As a co-founder, I was responsible for developing platform and communicating with different Cloud vendors including AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

## Education ðŸŽ“

- Bachelor degree, Shool of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/education/departments/fpmi/).

## Projects

Below are some of my projects that I have worked/working on:

### Project 1: [Twitter-NLP](https://github.com/AigozhiyevB/twitter-nlp) 
Description: This is an example project for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of text, identifying whether it is positive, negative, neutral or irrelivant.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Twitter-NLP](https://github.com/AigozhiyevB/twitter-nlp)

### Project 2: [ml-bases](https://github.com/AigozhiyevB/ml-bases)
Description: a set of small ML pproject based on DataSets from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
